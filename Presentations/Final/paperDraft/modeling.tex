Our model identifies two types of organisms belonging to the coral reef ecosystem as the most relevant organisms relating to the long term stability of a coral reef: macroalgae and algal turf. The interactions between these organisms can be described in the following directed graph, where the direction denotes which organism is benefited by the interaction,

We began by studying the following delay differential equation (DDE) model:
$$\begin{cases}
  \begin{array}{rl}
    \frac{dM}{dt}\hspace{-.8em}&=aMC - \frac{gM(t-\tau)}{1-C(t-\tau)} + \gamma M (1-M-C),\\
    \frac{dC}{dt}\hspace{-.8em}&=rC(1-M-C) - dC - aMC,
  \end{array}
\end{cases}$$ where  $\tau\geq0$ is a fixed time delay observed in the growth of algal turf upon the grazing of macroalgae; 
$r$ is the rate corals overgrow upon algal turfs; 
$d$ is the mortality rate of corals; 
$a$ is the rate that macroalgae overgrow upon corals; 
$\gamma$ is the rate that macroalgae spread over algal turfs, and; 
$g$ is the indiscriminate grazing rate of scarid,
and we also assume $a<d<\gamma<r<2\gamma$ and $0<g<\gamma$ \cite{Hastings}. 

Notice that algal turf (i.e. the third element of the ecosystem being considered) is given by $1-C-M$, as we assume that $M+C+T=1$, given that $\frac{dM}{dt}+\frac{dC}{dt}+\frac{dT}{dt}=0$. By analyzing the nullcline of this system, three equilibrium points are discovered:\begin{inparaenum}[(A)]
\setcounter{enumi}{13}
\item $(0,0)$;\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item $(0,1-\frac{g}{\gamma})$, and;\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item $(1-\frac{d}{r},0)$,
\end{inparaenum} and in Li et. al, 2014, these equilibrium points were discovered to be unstable, stable, and stable, respectively.

We extended the DDE model to a Stochastic DDE Model (SDDE) by accounting for noise in scarid grazing of macroalgae by adding a noise term in the derivative of $M$, 
$$\begin{cases}
\begin{array}{rl}
dM\hspace{-.8em}&=(aMC - \frac{gM(t-\tau)}{1-C(t-\tau)+\gamma M T})dt+{\color{red}\beta M(1-M)dW},\\
dC\hspace{-.8em}&=(rTC  - dC - aMC)dt.\\
\end{array}
\end{cases}$$ 

We denote the initial condition with $\theta$ in radians, such that $C=\sin(\theta)$ and $M=\cos(\theta)$. The impact of noise on the stability of the equilibrium points was studied using Monte Carlo simulations with varying values for $g\in[0.2,0.8]$, $\tau\in[0.5,1]$, $\beta\in[0,1]$, and $\theta\in(0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$.
